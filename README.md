# M152-Movie-Database
This Repository is for an Educational Project at BBZW. There are strict Requirements about the Technologies involved and about how the Application needs to implement certain things. If you are a Student at BBZW feel free to Copy all you want.


## Run a Demo
I made a Simple 4 Steps programm on how to start the Application Demo. This only runs on Linux.
### Step 1
Vertify that Docker and Docker-Compose are installed and that the Ports 1235 and 8080 are Free. You need an Active internet connection for the Build Process
### Step 2
There is a [docker-compose.yaml](docker-compose.yaml) File. This file isnt fully functional, but it works for the Database.
in the root directory of the project run the following command:
``` bash
docker-compose up -d database
```
With this command you start the Database container.
Run the  Wait for it to start up.
### Step 3
Run the Following command. With this command you run the contents of the [init.sql](init.sql) in the Database Container.
``` bash
docker exec -it movie-db-app mysql --password=sml12345 --user=root -e "$(cat init.sql)"
```
### Step 4
_you need to run this command in the root dir of the Project._ 

Run the following command to install the dependencies.
``` bash
npm i
```
Run the following command to start up the Application.
``` bash
npm start
```
Open this link [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

## Getting Started

### General Note
We use a MySQL database on Docker. This is the only way we tested it. There is a [Init.sql File](init.sql), this is the SQL-Code to set up the Database for the Application to run with. If you are Running into Issues, make sure the [Sequelize Config File](config/sequelize.js) matches your database.

### Pull Requests
Dont Push into Master, it will not work.
Make a Pull-Request to keep the Code Clean.
Make sure your code meets the Eslint Requirements.
After Making you PR, add someone to Review it


### Local Development

#### IDEA
Use intellij or Webstorm, i made Run Configs.

#### ESL
I Added eslint, you can run it over the Run Config or the NPM command.
It will also run on every Push.

#### Database 
For the Database we use a Database on Docker. There is a Run Config.
If you dont run the Container over the Run Config make sure to name the Container "Movie-DB" and
the MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD "sml12345" and the MYSQL_ROOT_HOST "%" and use the Local Port 1235.
Passwort f√ºr die ersten beiden Benutzer ist sml12345


#### SQL
All the SQL Code to set up the Database needs to be in the [Init.sql File](init.sql).
If you started you docker container over the Run Config or with the correct name you can execute all the SQL statements inside the file with the following command

``` bash
docker exec -it Movie-DB mysql --password=sml12345 --user=root -e "$(cat init.sql)"
```
