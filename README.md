# M152-Movie-Database

This Repository is for an Educational Project at BBZW. There are strict Requirements about the Technologies involved and about how the Application needs to implement certain things. If you are a Student at BBZW feel free to Copy all you want.

## Getting Started

### General Note
We use a MySQL database on Docker. This is the only way we tested it. There is a [Init.sql File](init.sql), this is the SQL-Code to set up the Database for the Application to run with. If you are Running into Issues, make sure the [Sequelize Config File](config/sequelize.js) matches your database.

### Pull Requests
Dont Push into Master, it will not work.
Make a Pull-Request to keep the Code Clean.
Make sure your code meets the Eslint Requirements.
After Making you PR, add someone to Review it


### Local Development

#### IDEA
Use intellij or Webstorm, i made Run Configs.

#### ESL
I Added eslint, you can run it over the Run Config or the NPM command.
It will also run on every Push.

#### Database 
For the Database we use a Database on Docker. There is a Run Config.
If you dont run the Container over the Run Config make sure to name the Container "Movie-DB" and
the MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD "sml12345" and the MYSQL_ROOT_HOST "%" and use the Local Port 1235.
Passwort f√ºr die ersten beiden Benutzer ist sml12345


#### SQL
All the SQL Code to set up the Database needs to be in the [Init.sql File](init.sql).
If you started you docker container over the Run Config or with the correct name you can execute all the SQL statements inside the file with the following command

``` bash
docker exec -it Movie-DB mysql --password=sml12345 --user=root -e "$(cat init.sql)"
```
